This is the firmware for a learn-to-walk toy car, a [BIG Bobby
Car](https://www.big.de/en/products/big-bobby-car/), modification which I have
built. It's a toy for toddlers. Using this modification, the car gets an engine
sound, lights, turn signals and an emergency siren.

## Hardware/Software
I'm running this on a custom development board I designed on an STM32F103C8
Cortex-M3 microcontroller. The schematics and Gerber files [are available as
well](https://github.com/johndoe31415/pcbs). To generate the HAL and
initialization code for the project, including the build system for the STM32
library, refer to the [mcuconfig
project](https://github.com/johndoe31415/mcuconfig).

## Name
The car is named after the [USS Defiant,
NX-74205](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Defiant), because it's a [tough
little car](https://youtu.be/TOyOa3eExMk?t=8).
