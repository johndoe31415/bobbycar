# bobbycar
This is the firmware for a BIG Bobby Car modification which I am building. It's
a toy for toddlers.

## Hardware/Software
I'm running this on a custom development board I designed on an STM32F103C8
Cortex-M3 microcontroller. The schematics and Gerber files [are available as
well](https://github.com/johndoe31415/pcbs). To generate the HAL and
initialization code for the project, including the build system for the STM32
library, refer to the [mcuconfig
project](https://github.com/johndoe31415/mcuconfig).
